My name is Abdelrahman Bakry. I’m a software architect, AI enthusiast, and entrepreneur. I’m originally from Egypt, but I’m now based in Dubai, UAE. I’m passionate about building innovative tech products, especially those that combine AI, big data, and great user experiences. I love exploring new ideas, meeting inspiring people, and enjoying good coffee. I’m also a big fan of travel and discovering unique places—although, oddly enough, I’m not much into overly sweet desserts. I’ll make an exception for kunafa and tiramisu though some temptations are just too hard to resist.
