I’m originally from Egypt, but I’m now based in Dubai, UAE. I’m passionate about building innovative tech products, especially those that combine AI, big data, and great user experiences. I love exploring new ideas, meeting inspiring people, and enjoying good coffee. I’m also a big fan of travel and discovering unique places—although, oddly enough, I’m not much into overly sweet desserts. I’ll make an exception for kunafa and tiramisu though some temptations are just too hard to resist.\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\nDubai Sports City\\n\\u202d+971569490923 (Mobile)\\nabdelrahmansalembakry@gmail\\n.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/abdelrahman-\\nbakry-39859464 (LinkedIn)\\nTop Skills\\nArchitecture Management\\nBack-End Web Development\\nEngineering Management\\nCertifications\\nProject Management: Technical\\nProjects\\nProject Management: Preventing\\nScope Creep\\nRuby Scripting for DevOps\\nProject Management Foundations:\\nLessons Learned\\nProgramming Foundations: Software\\nTesting/QA\\nAbdelrahman Bakry\\nSoftware Architect | Engineering Manager | AI & Machine Learning\\nEnthusiast | Generative AI\\nDubai, United Arab Emirates\\nSummary\\nFocused on the latest tech innovations, I specialize in integrating\\nAI, machine learning, and generative AI into real-world applications.\\nAs a Software Architect and Engineering Manager, I leverage my\\nexpertise in JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and Java to develop scalable,\\nintelligent web and mobile solutions.
